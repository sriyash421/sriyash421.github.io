I am currently a **third year undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering** at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am primarily interested in solving challenging problems in which agents must learn and make decisions over time in environments where theoretically optimal behavior is hard or impossible to achieve. My major research areas are **machine learning and reinforcement learning**.

I am the humanoid team head at <a href = "https://krssg.in"> Kharagpur Robosoccer Students Group </a>, an undergaduate research group under  <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=wkEq5s4AAAAJ&hl=en"> Prof. Alok Kanti Deb </a>. My work primarily focuses on developing cooperative multiagent systems for a humanoid team that will enable them to play football. I am also working with CERN Atlas Hong Kong Group under <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1551-5974">Prof. Luis Roberto Flores Castillo</a> on deep learning for high energy physics. We are building deep learning models to search for exotic particles in high energy atomic collisions. I have also explored the field of Natural Language Processing, and have worked under <a href="http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/">Prof. Niloy Ganguly</a> on text summarization, multi-task learning and twitter analysis.

I am looking for research internship opportunites in Summer 2021. Please contact me if you find me suitable.
